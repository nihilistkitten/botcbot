A WIP rewrite of an unofficial Discord bot for running games of Blood on the Clocktower.
This bot is not associated with BOTC or The Pandemonium Institute.

BOTC, and all the character names and other IP associated with it, are owned by TPI and
reproduced here with permission. Do not reproduce their work without their permission.

Constructive criticism or PRs are welcome.

We are fortunate enough to have access to some playtest characters which are not in this
public repo, hence some of the weird import statements. I haven't actually tested that
they catch all possible import errors, so you might want to create a blank
resources/playtest folder.
